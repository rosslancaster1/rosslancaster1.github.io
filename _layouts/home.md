Hello and welcome to my website. For a brief introduction my name is Ross Lancaster and I recently completed my graduate program in Business Analytics.
I created this site in order to showcase my projects and more thoroughly explain my background. Within each tab you can explore a selection of my projects
and various aspects of my experience. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or really for any reason at all. Thanks and I hope you enjoy.
