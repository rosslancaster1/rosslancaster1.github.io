## Graduate Education

In May 2022 I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a Master of Science in Business Analytics and a 4.0 GPA. After deciding that I did not want to apply to medical school I turned to this program in order to reconnect with my fascination for statistics that I had since a young age. Through my coursework I chose to focus on machine learning and data science while also gaining a foundation in business, finance, and marketing. For a detailed look at my coursework please see my transcript at the bottom of this page. 

## Undergraduate Education

In May 2021 I graduated summa cum laude from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a Bachelor of Science in Biology and a 4.0 GPA. My freshman year I started as an engineering student but quickly discovered that this was not a field that I found interesting. I'll take even the most boring topic in biology, cellular signalling pathways, over fluid mechanics and heat transfer anyday. While my main coursework focused on molecular biology and biochemistry, I tailored my humanities and social science elective to the public health and psychology pathways. For a detailed look at my coursework please see my transcript at the bottom of this page. My original intention with this degree was to go to medical school. However, after my work experiences in a hospital setting I discovered that being a doctor would not bring me fulfillment and would not be conducive to the lifestyle I wanted to adhere to. Thus, I turned my attention to the Business Analytics program at RPI.  

## High School 

In June 2017 I graduated from Lincoln High School as valedictorian of my class. In high school I served one term as class president and enjoyed captaining the math team and playing the trombone in the concert and jazz bands. The highlight of my high school career was definitley going on a "world tour" with the band as each year we would travel throughout the US and Canada to play and compete. Finally, I also spent time volunteering for Camp Invention, a non-profit summer camp ran by the National Inventors Hall of Fame that aims to build excitment and confidence in STEM in young children.
