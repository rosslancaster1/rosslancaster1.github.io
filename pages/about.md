Hello, my name is Ross Lancaster and for the majority of my life I have resided in Lincoln, RI.  I attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biology in May 2021 and a Master of Science in Business Analytics in May 2022. Throughout the rest of this website you can find ample information about my experience and skills. However, in order to get to know each other better, on this page I would like to share some more personal details. I'll go first. 

For the past few years I have been helping to run the RPI Curling team. I have served terms as president, vice president, public relations chair, and fundraising chair. During these terms I have booked nationwide travel with Concur, planned and ran events with 100+ attendees, handled the club's budget, acted as the club's representative to the USCA, ran multiple social media accounts, and sold slushies in the pouring rain. On the ice, RPI Curling has been the number one ranked college curling team in the nation 3 out of 5 of the years I have been a member. Last year I skipped the team at the College Curling National Championship where we ended in a tie for fifth place. I was also a part of the College Curling Virtual National Championship winning team in 2020 when in person play was suspended for Covid. In the future I hope to continue my career as an amateur curler.

Another fun fact about me is that I am incredibly flexible. While others may struggle to touch their toes at all I can touch mine with my elbows. However, I make sure to only use this power for good. Beyond stretching, other less important talents of mine include having the skills to be a professional Disney vacation planner when necessary and being a top 100 ranked player in the obscure video game Cloudberry Kingdom. 

You will also find that I am a huge fan of the TV show Survivor. From time to time I even make appearances on the Survivor Buffs podcast to discuss the show. The remainder of television habits mainly revolve around the Engligh Premier League or whatever game show happens to be on at the time. 

Occasionally in my free time I will work towards getting certifications that one might find to be less than applicable to most of life's challenges. Examples include being certified to identify the difference between black bears and grizzly bears by the state of Montana, being certified in landmine and explosive remnants of war safety by the United Nations, and being certified to officiate weddings in 47 states (sorry New York, North Carolina, and Viriginia). However, in order to return to some semblance of seriousness I will end with a list of some of my more relevant accomplishments.
