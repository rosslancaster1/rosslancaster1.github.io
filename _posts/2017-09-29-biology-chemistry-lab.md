Throughout my educational career I have taken an extensive number of laborratory courses in areas ranging from biology to chemistry to and physics. Listed below are some of the laboratory skills that I have gained over the years. 
# Biology Lab Skills

* Sterile Technique
* Pipetting
* Microscopy
* Gel Electrophoresis (Polyacrylamide and SDS-PAGE)
* Polymerase Chain Reaction
* Restriction Enzyme Mapping
* Molecular Hydribization
* Experience Working with Bacteria Cultures
  * Inoculation
  * Plasmid Amplification
  * Conjugation
  * Transformation
  * Reporter Constructs
* Enzyme Assays
* Blue/White Screens
* Western and Southern Blotting
* Vector NTI
* BLAST
