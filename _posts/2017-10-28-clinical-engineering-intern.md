## Company: Lifespan
### May 2018- August 2018

As a Clinical Engineering Intern my main task for the summer was aiding the department with Rhode Island Hospital's multimillion switch to GE devices. In this role I was able to participate in several meetings between GE and the clinical engineering department to work out the details and terms of this large deal. I also helped to prepare the materials and paperworks for these meetings. This role was essential in the growth of my professional skills
