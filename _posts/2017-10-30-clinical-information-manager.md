## Company: Envision Physician Services
## January 2020- May 2022

As a Clinical Information Manager (CIM) I partnered with emergency room physicians to deliver effective patient care. My duties included completing all documention for the physicians and keeping track of the treatment plans for all of their patients. In this role I needed to be cognizant of all of the relevant regulations for patient visit documentation and display a mastery of medical terminology. I gained experience using Epic and Meditech electronical medical record software, familiarity with  ICD-10 codes, and a deep understanding of emergency department operations. 

Initially, the purpose of taking this role was to gain the necessary experience to apply for medical school. However, despite electing to not apply I came away with skills vital for any career pass. A stressful day of work in the emergency room involves lives being on the line. Being able to stay calm in these situations is a valuable asset to have and can give perspective to live's other challenges. This role also required mastering the ability to decipher what is impactful from a constant stream of information. Quick and accurate documentaiton of said information was also required which rendered strong organization and time-management skills vital. Through this role I also gained experience working with and understanding government regulations to make sure that every patient visit was properly documented.  Finally, in the emergency department everyone must work together as a team in order to deliver the best patient care and in turn I gained years of experience in a fast-paced team-based environment.
