I have ample experience with both written and verbal communication utilizing both the Microsoft and Google suites of products. In addition to numerous written projects for college, as a Clinical Information Manager I would have to prepare around 20 patient notes per shift that were accurate and followed numerous regulations. This was aided by my ability to type around 80 words per minute, corrected for errors. A sample of my academic writing has also been featured in the Fall 2020 issue of the [Currents in Teaching and Learning academic journal](https://webcdn.worcester.edu/currents-in-teaching-and-learning/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2022/05/Currents-Volume-12-Issue-01-Fall-2020.pdf) (page 38) as an example of exemplary student writing.
