I have over two years of experience working in an emergency room as well as four months working interning in a clincial engineering department. Through this time I have developed a strong understanding of the business and behind the scenes side of a hospital. I have played an integral role in the work flow of an emergency room and understand the moving pieces required to keep everything running smoothly. I have limited experience in an operating room setting as well. In addition, I gained experience utilizing both Epic and Meditech, developed a mastery of medical terminology, and gained knowledge of various government regulations. These include HIPAA, EMTALA, MIPS measures, and ICD-10 codes.
